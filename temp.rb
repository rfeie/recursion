#split into one length array


#if array is not [] compare the first char to first char of next not null and push to new array

# how to break apart
	# array of original single vals
	# take first two arrays put into a "working match" array
	# until working match is null, sort into a temp array
	# once working is null, move the next two to working
	# once original is null, move temp to original
	# start again until "done" (which is what?)
